what all go into the pulse sequence
create the pS1+pS2=1 coherence:
initial density matrix has (+1,0), (0,+1) coherences; basically 9 non-zeros in stvx's;  (L=K=M=0,pIa=x,pIb=y,qIa=qIb=0) x,y in (-2,0,2)
what all goes into the mat vec multiplications?
One is the mat vec with kron(H1x,Iden), kron(Iden,H1x), dipolarx (x means superop)


Checks:
switch off dipolar term and get the 2d eldor signal
switch off hyperfine and get some mundane dipolar oscn
